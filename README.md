## Getting Started

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up and running the Whisper application on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and pip (Python package installer) installed on your system. If you don't have these installed, please refer to the Python [official guide](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) for installation instructions.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the `whisper_interface` directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd path_to_your_directory/whisper_interface
    ```
2. Install the required packages using the requirements.txt file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   In case you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Now, you can run the application using Python:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
   If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you may need to specify `python3`:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and run the Whisper Transcription Service. You can now upload your audio files and get them transcribed into your desired language.
